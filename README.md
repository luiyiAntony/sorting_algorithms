## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is for learning purposes, in order to compare the time performance of sorting algorithm (quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort).

## HOW TO RUN

Evaluate the algorithms

```sh
python main.py
```

After that, some results will be generated and saved in the `results.json` file.

Display results pictures

```sh
python graphics.py
```

Sorting test is for test an algorithm

```sh
python -m sorting_test.py
```
